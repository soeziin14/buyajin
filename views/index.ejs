        <h1>Jokes Aside...</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Jin Song. Thank you for visiting my blog and going through my obnoxious skeletal index page. To learn
            front-end development better, I decided to try everything from start instead of using a fancy template that
            lies out in the internet. And instead of
            going over everything I have in my resume (although you can find those information here), I wanted to make my
            introduction
            a little special, as I am sure you are bored of seeing serious, typical portfolio sites. I know the site could use
            tons of improvements, and I hope to work on it more soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am an energetic guy who likes to interact and have fun
            with people, even with clients! The photo was taken during IMSMA A1 training session in Spiez, Switzerland while
            I was on project IMSMA @ Novetta. You could see from the picture that I was very happy to be chosen to be sent
            to this beautiful place with great people.
            <br>
            <br>
            On a more academic and technical note, I studied at Northern Virginia Community College at Annandale,
            where I received associate degree in Economics. I then transferred to University of Virginia at Charlottesville.
            I changed my major to Computer Science and proceeded to graduate.
            At school, I took Java courses with some C++ background, so I am familiar with Object Oriented Programming.
            I still deem JAVA as my strongest language, but I believe Javascript comes in as close second, as I picked up
            and gained professional experience working on Handlebar.js, Ractive.js, and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>I am probably not the smartest nor most experienced you are looking for. However, I can guarantee persistent
            energy :]</p>
